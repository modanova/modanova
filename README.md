# Hi, I'm Manoela

Currently training with Founders and Coders as a software developer as my goal is to change careers and get into Tech.

In the meantime, I am finishing the school year at a primary school as a Year 3 class teacher. I have trained at primary schools and gained a PGCE with Qualified Teacher Status, at the University of Cumbria, London. 

Previously, I have also worked as a German teacher to children and adults in Bulgaria, as well as a childminder and nursery nurse in Denmark.
