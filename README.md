# Hi there :wave:

I am Manoela, currently training with Founders and Coders as a software developer as my goal is to change careers and get into Tech.

Just finished the school year at a primary school as a Year 3 class teacher. Previously, I have also worked as a German teacher to children and adults in Bulgaria, as well as a childminder and nursery nurse in Denmark.

Curuous fact: I love board games! :game_die:
